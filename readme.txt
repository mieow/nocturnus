Neat and unobtrusive dark theme, ideal for Clubs and Societies.

== Description ==

This theme was originally created for a clubs and societies website to look like one specific configuration
of the Suffusion theme.  Then it was modified to provide some basic layout and customisation options.

Nocturnus is suitable for content-focused websites that want the navigation and headers to be neat and
convenient and with a dark background.
